Both declarations below create integer pointers.
int *p;
int* q;

The first approach is my choice because it's going to give you more clarity when you declare more than one variables in one line. For instance:
int *p, *r, *t; // They are the pointers of integer.
int *p, r, t // p is pointer; r and t are integers.
													
While the second approach is not clear or might get confusing for us. 
For example:
int* q, t, r; // q is a pointer of integer; t and r are two integers.
Or int* q, * t, * r; // This is correct of declaration of pointers, but instead putting a space between asterisk and letter we can use the first approach!
